# GameDevTV-Skill-Builder---BASIC-TELEPORTING-QUEST
Skill Builder Challenge 1
In this 3D First Person Quest we finish implementing a half-coded teleport mechanic and a bounce mechanic so that we can make a fun puzzle moment for the player. 
We use Transform.Position, coroutines, adding force and practice level layout.
